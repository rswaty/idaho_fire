## Historical Fire "minus" Agricultural and Developed Land Uses in `r ROI`

On the [Historical Fire](docs/historical_fire.qmd) we simply presented information on the fire regimes that may have been on the landscape pre-European Colonization.  While that information provides important context, baselines and background on how important fire may be as a disturbance for particular ecosystems, we are now working in landscapes that often have land uses that are incompatible with fire including development and agriculture.  Here we 'subtract' those land uses from our historical fire numbers as a first step in calibrating potential fire management on the landscape today. 

Below we present:

1. Summary bullets
2. Maps of current agricultural and developed land uses, and historical Mean Fire Return Intervals (MFRI) with agricultural and developed lands masked out. 
3. Charts of:
    * levels of natural, agricultural and developed area per Biophysical Setting (BpS)
    * changes to historical annual acres burned due to conversion to agricultural and developed land uses
    * changes to historical annual acres burned per fire severity type due to conversion to agricultural and developed land uses
    
## Summary

We combined LANDFIRE's [Existing Vegetation Type (EVT)](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/evt) data with LANDFIRE's [Biophysical Settings (BpS)](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps) so that we could explore conversion to agricultural and developed land uses, and to see how much area could burn per year on the remaining lands if historical fire regimes were implemented.

* We found that roughly **`r percent_converted`%** of `r ROI` has been converted total, with **`r percent_agricultural_total`%** conversion to agricultural and **`r percent_developed_total`% ** conversion to developed land uses.
* Historically **`r scales::comma(sum_all_hist_fire)` ** acres burned annually.  If fires burned with historical fire regimes on current non-agricultural or developed lands **`r scales::comma(sum_all_hist_fire_minus_ag_dev)` **  acres would burn annually.  

## Conversion Map, and Change to Fire Regime map

First, we present a map of agricultural and developed land uses as mapped in LANDFIRE's EVT data.

Below is the historical fire regime map presented on the home page with the areas currently mapped as agricultural or developed land uses masked out with white.

## Changes in Historical Annual Acres Burned due to Conversion

The chart below depicts the change in annual acres burned when agricultural and developed lands are removed from the equation.  In other words, what would be the annual area burned on 'natural' lands today if we had historical fire regimes?

The reduction of annual acres burned is in parentheses.  Top ten BpSs shown.
