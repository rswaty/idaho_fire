    "text": "Almost raw historical fire regime data table\nAs noted above for the charts and data table we removed some columns (e.g., color ramp), added some calculations (e.g., annual acres burned) and renamed the columns for easier work in R and for clarity. Below you can filter, sort and explore the data. In the following table:\n\n‘fri’ = fire return interval, or the mean number of years between fires\nThere are several columns that will be ‘off screen’. Look for horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the table.\nthe “annual_probability_____” columns refer to the ‘chance’ that a location had that particular type of fire during a year on average.\n\nLANDFIRE used the annual probabilities in the original modeling (see Blankenship et al., (2021) for more information). Below is an example of how the math works:\nExample calculation of MFRI and annual acres burned for a 1,000 acre ecosystem with a 0.2 annual probability of fire:\n\n\\[\nMFRI = 1/0.2 = 5ys\n\\] \\[\nAnnualAcresBurned = 1,000ac*0.2 = 50ac\n\\]"
