## Historical Fire in `r ROI`

On this page we look to the past, just before European colonization to explore historical fire regimes: which ecosystems burned, how much they would have burned per year and they types of fire those ecosystems had.  

Below we present:

1. a summary of historical fire regimes including an 'artistic' strip chart
2. a simple bar chart of acres per Biophysical Setting (historical ecosystem) colored by historical fire regime
3. a panel chart splitting out annual fire amounts by BpS and fire severity type

## Summary

From a quick assessment of the historical Mean Fire Return Intervals for `r ROI` we found:

* Roughly **`r scales::comma(total_acres_burned)`** acres burned annually or **`r percent_of_roi_burned`%** of `r ROI`.
* There were **`r number_of_bps`** Biophysical Settings (by name, there may be more if counting by variants).  The **`r top_bps_name`** was the most prevalent overall, with the **`r top_bps_fire`** having the most fire annually.
* Mean Fire Return Intervals for all fire types combined ranged from **`r min_all_fri `** to **`r max_all_fri `** years, with an area weighted mean of **`r area_weighted_mean_all`** (weighted by acres of BpSs)

The 'strip chart' below is intended to introduce the charts that follow.   

* The colors are set by the historical Mean Fire Return Interval, with yellows indicating fewer years between fires, darker colors indicating more years between fires
* There is one rectangle per BpS; size of rectangle proportional to acres mapped.  BpSs < 1,000ac not shown.
* Hover over rectangles to get more information.

## Fire Return Interval and Severity by Biophysical Setting

LANDFIRE's [Biophysical Settings](https://www.landfire.gov/vegetation/bps) tells many stories.  Officially it is:

>a modeled representation of the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of modeled past disturbance regimes. LF uses BPS to depict reference conditions of vegetation across landscapes.

It show us where vegetation systems may have occurred historically under natural disturbance regimes, and allows us to explore historical fire regimes including their Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI) by fire type.  The dataset includes multiple attributes including:

* BPS_CODE 	Biophysical Settings (BpS) code used by LANDFIRE
* ZONE 	National Land Cover Database Map Zone the BpS relates to
* BPS_MODEL 	Unique BpS model code
* BPS_NAME 	BpS Name
* FRI_REPLAC 	Average historic replacement fire frequency (greater than 75% top kill of vegetation)
* FRI_MIXED 	Average historic mixed fire frequency
* FRI_SURFAC 	Average historic surface fire frequency
* FRI_ALL Quantifies the average period between fires (all types).

You can download the raw attribute table [here](https://www.landfire.gov/sites/default/files/CSV/LF2023/LF23_BPS_240.csv) and the data dictionary [here](https://www.landfire.gov/sites/default/files/DataDictionary/LF2023/LF23_BPSADD_240.pdf).

For the charts and data table below we added some additional calculations such as annual acres burned by fire severity.  

*Also see below for FRI_ALL "All Fires" calculation*

### Mean Fire Return Inverval by Biophysical Setting

The chart below indicates the total area (in acres) per Biophysical Setting and "All Fires" Mean Fire Return Interval (years, in parentheses).  Colors set to match those of the map on the home page, and of the strip chart above.

## Almost raw historical fire regime data table

As noted above for the charts and data table we removed some columns (e.g., color ramp), added some calculations (e.g., annual acres burned) and renamed the columns for easier work in R and for clarity.  Below you can filter, sort and explore the data.  In the following table:

* 'fri' = fire return interval, or the mean number of years between fires
* There are several columns that will be 'off screen'.  Look for horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the table.
* the "annual_probability_____" columns refer to the 'chance' that a location had that particular type of fire during a year on average.  

LANDFIRE used the annual probabilities in the original modeling (see [Blankenship et al., (2021)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.3484) for more information).  Below is an example of how the math works:

Example calculation of MFRI and annual acres burned for a 1,000 acre ecosystem with a 0.2 annual probability of fire:

<br>

$$
MFRI = 1/0.2 = 5ys
$$
$$
AnnualAcresBurned = 1,000ac*0.2 = 50ac
$$
